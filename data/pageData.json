    "During my education, one of the most influential classes I took was “Literature in the Age of AI” taught by professor <a href='www.google.com' class='secondary-text white-link'>Dennis Tenen</a>. My eyes were opened to the ways that computer science, philosophy, and art could intermix and I wanted to contribute in my own way.",
    "I have always been interested in visual arts, and have an array of work you can check out <a href='www.google.com' class='secondary-text white-link'>here</a>. In the future, I want to create pieces of art that incorporate computer science, literature, and design into something new and powerful."
