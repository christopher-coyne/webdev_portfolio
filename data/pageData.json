    "During my education, one of the most influential classes I took was “Literature in the Age of AI” taught by professor <a href='www.google.com' class='secondary-text white-link'>Dennis Tenen</a>. My eyes were opened to the ways that computer science, philosophy, and art could intermix and I wanted to contribute in my own way. My final project for the class explored the universal language developed by philosopher John Wilkins, and sought to <a href='https://medium.com/@christcoyne/wilkins-and-the-universal-language-ccd14ac2179b'>recreate it using modern AI tools</a>.",
    "I have always been passionate about the visual arts, and have an array of work you can check out <a href='www.google.com' class='secondary-text white-link'>here</a>. In the future, I hope to create pieces that combine art and computer science into something new."
